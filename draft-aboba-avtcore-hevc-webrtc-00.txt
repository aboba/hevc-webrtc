                 draft-aboba-avtcore-hevc-webrtc-00.txt

Abstract

   RFC 7742 defines WebRTC video processing and codec requirements,
   including guidance for endpoints supporting the VP8 and H.264 codecs,
   which are mandatory to implement.  With support for H.265 under
   development in WebRTC browsers, the need has arisen to provide
   similar guidance for browsers desiring to support the (optional)
   H.265 codec, whose RTP payload format is defined in RFC 7798.

INTERNET-DRAFT          H.265 Profile for WebRTC           11 April 2023


1.  Introduction

   "RTP Payload Format for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)"
   [RFC7798] defines the encapsulation of H.265 within the Real-time
   Transport Protocol (RTP).  While "WebRTC Video Processing and Codec
   Requirements" [RFC7742] provides guidance for endpoints supporting
   the mandatory to implement VP8 and H.264 codecs, it does not cover
   H.265. With H.265 support under development within WebRTC browsers,
   the need has arisen to profile [RFC7798] for WebRTC implementations
   choosing to support H.265.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  H.265 Support

   WebRTC browsers and non-browsers MAY implement the H.265 video codec
   as described in [RFC7798] and [HEVC]. WebRTC browsers and non-
   browsers supporting H.265 MUST support receiving, and MAY support the
   ability to send H.265.

   For the [HEVC] codec, endpoints MUST support the payload formats
   defined in [RFC7798].  In addition, they MUST support Main Profile
   Level 3.1 (level-id=93) and SHOULD support Main Profile Level 4
   (level-id=120).

   Implementations of the HEVC codec have utilized a wide variety of
   optional parameters.  To improve interoperability, the following
   parameter settings are specified:

   level-id:  Implementations MUST include this parameter within SDP and
   MUST interpret it when receiving it.

   max-fps, max-cpb, max-dpb, and max-br:

   These parameters allow the implementation to specify that they can
   support certain features of HEVC at higher rates and values than
   those signaled by their level (set with level-id).  Implementations
   MAY include these parameters in their SDP, but they SHOULD interpret
   them when receiving them, allowing them to send the highest quality
   of video possible.

   sprop-vps, sprop-sps, sprop-pps, sprop-sei: HEVC allows sequence and

   picture information to be sent both in-band and out-of-band.  WebRTC
   implementations MUST signal this information in-band.  This means
   that WebRTC implementations MUST NOT include these parameters in the
   SDP they generate.

   When the use of the video orientation (CVO) RTP header extension is
   not signaled as part of the SDP, H.265 implementations MAY send and
   SHOULD support proper interpretation of Display Orientation SEI
   messages.

   Unless otherwise signaled, implementations that use H.265 MUST encode
   and decode pixels with an implied 1:1 (square) aspect ratio.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document is subject to the security considerations described in
   Section 7 of [RFC7742].

   In addition to those security considerations, H.265 implementers are
   advised to take note of the "Security Considerations" Section 9 of
   [RFC7798], including requirements pertaining to SEI messages.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require actions by IANA.
